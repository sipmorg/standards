== Identity testing

[[sec-identity-general]]
=== General requirements

Identity testing shall be performed to confirm that plant material or
preparations are authentic and correctly identified.

=== Methods of identity testing

==== Macroscopic examination

Macroscopic examination shall include:

* Visual assessment of color, form, and texture
* Odor assessment (where appropriate)
* Comparison with authenticated reference material or written description

==== Microscopic examination

Microscopic examination shall include:

* Observation of characteristic cellular structures
* Comparison with reference material or photomicrographs
* Documentation of distinguishing features

NOTE: Microscopic examination is particularly important for powdered materials.

==== Chromatographic methods

Chromatographic methods for identity testing shall:

* Produce a fingerprint characteristic of the species
* Include comparison with authenticated reference material
* Document retention times and peak patterns

Acceptable chromatographic methods include:

* Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
* High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
* Gas chromatography (GC)

==== Spectroscopic methods

Spectroscopic methods may be used for identity testing, including:

* Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR)
* Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
* Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)

==== DNA-based methods

DNA-based authentication shall:

* Use validated marker regions appropriate for the species
* Include appropriate positive and negative controls
* Be performed by competent laboratories

[[sec-identity-acceptance]]
=== Acceptance criteria

Material shall be considered positively identified when:

a) Results of identity testing are consistent with reference material or
   documented characteristics
b) No evidence of adulteration or substitution is detected
c) Testing is performed by qualified personnel using validated methods
