[[potency]]
== Potency determination

[[sec-potency-general]]
=== General requirements

Potency determination quantifies the concentration of active constituents or
marker compounds in plant materials and preparations.

[[sec-analyte-selection]]
=== Analyte selection

==== Active constituents

When known active constituents are identified:

* Quantification of active constituents is preferred
* Multiple actives may be quantified when relevant to efficacy
* Bioactive fractions may be quantified as a group

==== Marker compounds

When active constituents are not fully characterized:

* Characteristic or analytical markers may be used
* The relationship between markers and activity shall be documented
* Selection of markers shall be scientifically justified

[[sec-methods]]
=== Quantitative methods

==== Chromatographic methods

Chromatographic methods for potency determination shall:

* Be validated for specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity, and range
* Use reference standards of known purity
* Include system suitability tests

==== Spectrophotometric methods

Spectrophotometric methods may be used when:

* Chromatographic methods are not practical
* The analyte or analyte group has characteristic absorption
* Interference from other components has been evaluated

[[sec-specifications]]
=== Specifications

Acceptance criteria for potency shall be established based on:

* Historical data for the species
* Phytochemical variability
* Clinical or traditional use information
* Manufacturing requirements
