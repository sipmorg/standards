== Purity testing

[[sec-purity-general]]
=== General requirements

Purity testing shall be performed to ensure that plant materials and
preparations are free from unacceptable levels of contaminants.

[[sec-contaminants]]
=== Contaminant categories

==== Foreign matter

Testing for foreign matter shall address:

* Other plant species
* Plant parts other than the intended part
* Inert materials (soil, stones, etc.)

Acceptance criteria shall be specified based on pharmacopoeial standards or
product specifications.

==== Heavy metals

Heavy metal testing shall include, at minimum:

* Lead (Pb)
* Cadmium (Cd)
* Mercury (Hg)
* Arsenic (As)

Acceptance limits shall be established based on regulatory requirements or
risk assessment.

<<ICHQ3R8>>

==== Pesticide residues

Pesticide residue testing shall:

* Include pesticides commonly used in cultivation of the species
* Consider pesticides from previous land use
* Comply with regulatory limits for the intended market

==== Mycotoxins

Mycotoxin testing shall be performed when:

* Material is susceptible to fungal contamination
* Storage conditions may promote fungal growth
* Regulatory requirements apply

Common mycotoxins to be tested include:

* Aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2)
* Ochratoxin A
* Fumonisins

==== Microbiological contamination

Microbiological testing shall address:

* Total aerobic microbial count
* Yeast and mold count
* Specified pathogenic organisms

Acceptance criteria shall be based on intended use and regulatory requirements.

==== Solvent residues

For extracts prepared using organic solvents, testing shall verify that
residual solvent levels are within acceptable limits.
