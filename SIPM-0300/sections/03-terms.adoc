== Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.
Terms defined in SIPM-0001 also apply where relevant.

=== analytical procedure

detailed description of the steps required to perform an analytical test

NOTE: Analytical procedures include sample preparation, measurement, and
calculation steps.

=== method validation

process of demonstrating that an analytical procedure is suitable for its
intended purpose

=== specificity
alt:[selectivity]

ability of an analytical procedure to assess unequivocally the analyte in the
presence of components that may be expected to be present

=== accuracy
alt:[trueness]

closeness of agreement between the value found and the value accepted as true

=== precision

closeness of agreement between a series of measurements obtained from multiple
sampling of the same homogeneous sample under prescribed conditions

=== repeatability

precision under the same operating conditions over a short interval of time

=== intermediate precision

precision within-laboratory variations, such as different days, different
analysts, different equipment

=== reproducibility

precision between laboratories

=== limit of detection
alt:[LOD]

lowest amount of analyte that can be detected but not necessarily quantified

=== limit of quantitation
alt:[LOQ]

lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined with suitable
precision and accuracy

=== linearity

ability of an analytical procedure to obtain test results that are directly
proportional to the concentration of analyte within a given range

=== range

interval between upper and lower concentration amounts of analyte for which
the analytical procedure has suitable precision, accuracy, and linearity

=== robustness

capacity of an analytical procedure to remain unaffected by small, but
deliberate variations in method parameters

=== reference standard

substance or material characterized for use as a measurement standard in
analytical procedures

NOTE: Reference standards may be primary standards or working standards.

=== system suitability

evaluation of the components of an analytical system to ensure that the system
is operating within acceptable parameters before analysis
