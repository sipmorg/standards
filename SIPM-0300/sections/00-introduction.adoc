== Introduction

The quality and safety of phytomedicine products depend on reliable analytical
methods for identity verification, purity assessment, and potency determination.
Unlike conventional pharmaceuticals, phytomedicines present unique analytical
challenges due to their complex chemical composition and natural variability.

This document establishes general requirements for analytical methods used in
the quality control of phytomedicine products. It provides a framework for
method selection, validation, and application that ensures reliable and
reproducible results across laboratories and jurisdictions.

The standard addresses three fundamental aspects of phytomedicine analysis:

* **Identity**: Confirming that the material is what it purports to be
* **Purity**: Ensuring the material is free from unacceptable contamination
* **Potency**: Determining the concentration of active or marker constituents

This document is intended to be used in conjunction with specific analytical
method standards in the SIPM-0300 series, which provide detailed procedures
for particular tests and analytes.
