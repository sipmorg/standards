[[validation]]
== Method validation

[[sec-validation-requirements]]
=== Validation requirements

Analytical methods shall be validated before use in quality control testing.
Validation shall be documented and shall demonstrate that the method is fit
for its intended purpose.

[[sec-validation-parameters]]
=== Validation parameters

Validation shall address the parameters specified in <<table-validation-params>>,
as applicable to the method type.

[[sec-protocol]]
=== Validation protocol

A validation protocol shall be prepared that includes:

* Objective of the validation
* Description of the analytical procedure
* Parameters to be evaluated
* Acceptance criteria for each parameter
* Experimental design and sample requirements

[[sec-report]]
=== Validation report

A validation report shall be prepared that includes:

* Conclusion on method suitability
* Any deviations from the protocol and their impact

[[sec-revalidation]]
=== Revalidation

Methods shall be revalidated when:

* The method is transferred to another laboratory
* Results indicate the method is no longer performing adequately

[[sec-stability-testing]]
=== Stability testing

Stability testing shall be conducted to establish shelf-life specifications
for botanical materials and finished products.

NOTE: Stability testing for botanical products shall follow ICH Q1 guidelines
adapted for the unique characteristics of plant-based materials <<ICHQ1A>>.

==== Storage conditions

Long-term and accelerated stability studies shall be conducted under the
following conditions:

[[table-stability-conditions]]
.Stability testing storage conditions
[cols="25%,25%,25%,25%"]
|===
| Study type | Temperature | Humidity | Duration

| Long-term (Zone I/II)
| 25 deg C ± 2 deg C
| 60% RH ± 5% RH
| 24-36 months

| Long-term (Zone III/IVa)
| 30 deg C ± 2 deg C
| 65% RH ± 5% RH
| 24-36 months

| Long-term (Zone IVb)
| 30 deg C ± 2 deg C
| 75% RH ± 5% RH
| 24-36 months

| Accelerated
| 40 deg C ± 2 deg C
| 75% RH ± 5% RH
| 6 months

| Intermediate (if accelerated fails)
| 30 deg C ± 2 deg C
| 65% RH ± 5% RH
| 12 months
|===

==== Testing intervals

Samples shall be tested at the following intervals:

* Long-term studies: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months
* Accelerated studies: 0, 3, and 6 months
* Additional timepoints as needed to characterize degradation profile

==== Stability-indicating methods

Stability-indicating methods shall:

* Demonstrate specificity for marker compounds and potential degradation
  products
* Detect changes in active constituent concentrations
* Quantify degradation products when applicable
* Be validated according to ICH Q2(R1) requirements

.Stability indicators for botanical products
[cols="40%,60%"]
|===
| Parameter | Assessment method

| Marker compound content
| HPLC, UPLC quantification of characteristic compounds

| Degradation products
| HPLC-DAD, LC-MS detection of degradation markers

| Physical appearance
| Color, odor, texture assessment; spectrophotometric analysis

| Moisture content
| Loss on drying (LOD), Karl Fischer titration

| Microbiological quality
| Total aerobic count, yeast/mold, specified pathogens

| Heavy metals
| ICP-MS, AAS for elemental contaminants
|===

==== Shelf-life extrapolation

Shelf-life may be extrapolated from accelerated data according to the
following principles:

* If accelerated data show no significant change: Shelf-life may be
  extrapolated to twice the accelerated period, not exceeding 36 months
* If significant change occurs at accelerated conditions: Intermediate
  conditions data shall be used; shelf-life extrapolation limited
* Statistical analysis (e.g., linear regression at 95% confidence) shall
  support shelf-life claims
