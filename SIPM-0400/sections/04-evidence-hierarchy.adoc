[[sec-evidence-levels]]
=== Levels of evidence

Evidence for phytomedicine safety and efficacy shall be classified according
to a hierarchical system that reflects the relative strength of different
evidence types.

[cols="15%,25%,60%"]
|===
| Level | Evidence type | Description

| Level I
| Systematic reviews of RCTs
| Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials

| Level II
| Randomized controlled trials
| Well-designed randomized controlled trials with adequate sample size

| Level III
| Non-randomized controlled studies
| Controlled studies without randomization, cohort studies

| Level IV
| Case series and case reports
| Uncontrolled studies, case series, case reports

| Level V
| Traditional use evidence
| Documented historical use, ethnobotanical records, traditional knowledge

[[sec-evidence-weighting]]
=== Evidence weighting

When evaluating the totality of evidence, the following factors shall be
considered:

* Study design (higher levels provide stronger evidence)
* Methodological quality of individual studies
* Consistency of findings across studies
* Directness of evidence to the population and intervention of interest
* Precision of effect estimates

[[sec-traditional-evidence]]
=== Traditional use evidence

Traditional use evidence may be considered as supporting evidence when:

* The phytomedicine has been used for a defined period (typically 30+ years)
* The conditions of use (dose, route, population) are documented
* Safety information is available from traditional use
* The traditional preparation method is relevant to the modern product

NOTE: Traditional use evidence alone is generally insufficient to support
efficacy claims in most regulatory jurisdictions, but may support safety
and guide clinical research design.
