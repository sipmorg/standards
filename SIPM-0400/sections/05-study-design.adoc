== Study design considerations

[[sec-product-characterization]]
=== Product characterization

==== Identity and quality

The investigational phytomedicine product shall be fully characterized,
including:

* Botanical identity (species, plant part, geographic origin)
* Manufacturing process and quality control
* Phytochemical profile (marker compounds, batch-to-batch consistency)
* Specifications and certificate of analysis

NOTE: Poor product characterization is a common limitation of published
phytomedicine clinical studies.

==== Standardization

When applicable, the study product shall be standardized to defined marker
compounds or active constituents.

[[sec-study-population]]
=== Study population

==== Participant selection

The study population shall be defined by:

* Inclusion criteria appropriate to the research question
* Exclusion criteria that address safety concerns
* Relevant demographic and clinical characteristics

==== Sample size

Sample size calculations shall be performed and documented, based on:

* Expected effect size
* Variability in primary outcome measures
* Statistical power requirements
* Significance level

[[sec-outcome-measures]]
=== Outcome measures

==== Primary outcomes

Primary outcomes shall:

* Be clinically relevant to the indication
* Be valid, reliable, and responsive to change
* Be specified a priori in the study protocol

==== Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes may include:

* Additional clinical measures
* Quality of life assessments
* Biomarkers
* Safety outcomes

[[sec-control-interventions]]
=== Control interventions

Control interventions may include:

* Placebo (when ethically appropriate)
* Active comparator (standard treatment)
* No treatment (for pragmatic trials)
* Dose comparison

Placebo control shall match the investigational product in appearance, taste,
and smell where possible.

[[sec-study-duration]]
=== Study duration

Study duration shall be:

* Appropriate to the indication and expected time to effect
* Sufficient to detect both efficacy and safety signals
* Justified in the study protocol

For chronic conditions, long-term safety data (6+ months) is typically required.
