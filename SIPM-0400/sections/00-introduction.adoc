== Introduction

The establishment of clinical evidence is fundamental to the responsible use of
phytomedicine in healthcare. While traditional use provides valuable historical
context, modern evidence-based practice requires rigorous clinical research to
establish safety and efficacy.

This document provides a framework for the generation, evaluation, and reporting
of clinical evidence for phytomedicine products. It recognizes the unique
challenges of clinical research in phytomedicine, including:

* Complexity of multi-component botanical preparations
* Variability in product composition between studies
* Integration of traditional knowledge with modern research methods
* Ethical considerations in studying traditional remedies

The standard addresses the complete evidence generation process:

* Classification of evidence types and their relative weight
* Study design considerations specific to phytomedicine
* Quality assessment of clinical studies
* Transparent reporting of methods and results

This document is intended to support:

* Researchers designing clinical studies of phytomedicines
* Regulatory bodies evaluating marketing authorization applications
* Healthcare professionals assessing evidence for clinical practice
* Manufacturers developing evidence-based products
