== Quality assessment of clinical studies

[[sec-quality-criteria]]
=== Quality criteria

The methodological quality of clinical studies shall be assessed using
validated assessment tools appropriate to the study design.

[[table-quality-tools]]
.Quality assessment tools by study design
[cols="40%,60%"]
|===
| Study design | Assessment tool

| Randomized controlled trials
| Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, Jadad scale

| Non-randomized studies
| Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, ROBINS-I

| Systematic reviews
| AMSTAR 2, ROBIS
|===

[[sec-quality-domains]]
=== Quality domains for RCTs

Quality assessment of randomized controlled trials shall address:

* Random sequence generation
* Allocation concealment
* Blinding of participants and personnel
* Blinding of outcome assessment
* Incomplete outcome data
* Selective reporting
* Other sources of bias

[[sec-transparency]]
=== Transparency requirements

To support quality assessment, clinical studies shall be:

* Registered in a public trials registry before enrollment
* Conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
* Reported completely and transparently
* Made available through open access when possible

[[sec-pharmacovigilance]]
=== Pharmacovigilance requirements

Adverse event monitoring for phytomedicines shall be conducted according to
the requirements specified in this clause.

NOTE: The World Health Organization recommends integrating safety monitoring
of herbal medicines into existing pharmacovigilance systems <<WHO2025>>.

==== Spontaneous reporting

Spontaneous reporting systems shall capture adverse events associated with
phytomedicine use:

* All serious adverse events (death, life-threatening, hospitalization,
  disability, congenital anomaly) shall be reported within 15 calendar days
* Non-serious adverse events shall be reported according to local regulatory
  requirements
* Reports shall include: patient demographics, suspect product (with batch
  number and botanical identification), adverse event description, outcome,
  and concomitant medications

==== Signal detection

Signal detection for phytomedicine safety shall employ validated
pharmacovigilance methods:

[[table-signal-methods]]
.Signal detection methods for phytomedicine pharmacovigilance
[cols="40%,60%"]
|===
| Method | Description

| Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR)
| Compares proportion of specific adverse event for a product vs. all other
products

| Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)
| Measures association between product and adverse event using case-control
approach

| Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS)
| Bayesian data mining algorithm for detecting signals in large databases

| Disproportionality analysis
| Statistical comparison of observed vs. expected reporting rates
|===

==== Causality assessment

Causality assessment for adverse events associated with phytomedicines shall
use standardized algorithms:

* WHO-UMC causality categories (certain, probable, possible, unlikely,
  conditional, unassessable)
* Naranjo algorithm (definite, probable, possible, doubtful)

NOTE: Causality assessment for herbal medicines presents unique challenges
due to variability in product composition and limited documentation of
concomitant use <<Kongkaew2024>>.

==== Periodic safety reporting

Marketing authorization holders for phytomedicines shall submit:

* Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) at intervals specified by regulatory
  authorities
* Risk Management Plans (RMPs) for products with identified safety concerns
* Annual safety reports for products marketed under traditional use or
  dietary supplement regulations

[[sec-herb-drug-interactions]]
=== Herb-drug interaction documentation

==== Mechanism-based assessment

Herb-drug interactions shall be evaluated based on pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic mechanisms:

[[table-hdi-mechanisms]]
.Common herb-drug interaction mechanisms
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| Mechanism | Examples and clinical significance

| Cytochrome P450 inhibition
| _Grapefruit juice_ (CYP3A4); _Hypericum perforatum_ (CYP3A4 induction);
reduced drug levels or increased toxicity

| P-glycoprotein transport
| _Panax ginseng_ (P-gp inhibition); altered drug absorption and distribution

| Pharmacodynamic synergism
| Anticoagulant herbs + warfarin (increased bleeding risk); sedative herbs +
CNS depressants (enhanced sedation)

| Pharmacodynamic antagonism
| Stimulant herbs + antihypertensives (reduced efficacy)
|===

==== Documentation requirements

Clinical studies of phytomedicines shall document:

* Potential herb-drug interactions based on known mechanisms
* Concomitant medications used by study participants
* Observed interactions during the study
* Post-study monitoring for delayed interactions
