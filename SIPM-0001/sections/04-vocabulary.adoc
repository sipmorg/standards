== Additional vocabulary

This clause provides additional vocabulary organized by domain.

=== Extraction and processing

==== maceration

extraction process in which plant material is soaked in a solvent at room
temperature for an extended period

==== percolation

extraction process in which solvent passes through a column or bed of plant
material, typically under gravity or low pressure

==== decoction

extraction process involving boiling plant material in water

NOTE: Decoction is traditionally used for hard plant materials such as roots,
bark, and seeds.

==== infusion

extraction process in which plant material is steeped in hot or cold water
without boiling

NOTE: Infusion is traditionally used for delicate plant materials such as
leaves and flowers.

==== tincture
alt:[alcoholic extract]

liquid preparation obtained by maceration or percolation of plant material in
a mixture of alcohol and water

NOTE: Tinctures are typically prepared at defined drug-to-extract ratios.

==== fluid extract
alt:[liquid extract]

liquid preparation containing the active constituents of plant material,
typically more concentrated than a tincture

==== dry extract

solid extract obtained by removal of the extraction solvent, typically through
evaporation or freeze-drying

==== soft extract
alt:[semi-solid extract]

extract with a viscous or semi-solid consistency, typically containing
residual moisture or solvent

==== drug-to-extract ratio
alt:[DER]

ratio of the mass of starting plant material to the mass of the resulting
extract

[example]
A 10:1 drug-to-extract ratio indicates that 10 kg of plant material yields
1 kg of extract.

=== Quality and testing

==== identity testing

analytical procedures performed to confirm that a material is what it purports
to be

NOTE: Identity testing may include macroscopic examination, microscopic
analysis, chromatographic fingerprinting, and spectroscopic methods.

==== purity testing

analytical procedures performed to determine the presence and amount of
impurities or contaminants

==== potency

measure of the biological activity or strength of a phytomedicine, typically
expressed relative to a reference standard

==== fingerprint

chromatographic or spectroscopic pattern that is characteristic of a particular
plant material or extract

NOTE: Fingerprints are used for identity confirmation and quality comparison.

==== specification

list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance
criteria for a material

=== Dosage forms

==== oral liquid
alt:[liquid for oral use]

liquid preparation intended for oral administration

==== tablet

solid dosage form containing phytomedicine ingredients, usually prepared by
compression

==== capsule

solid dosage form in which the phytomedicine ingredient is enclosed in a
soluble container, typically made of gelatin or plant-derived materials

==== topical preparation
alt:[preparation for dermal use]

preparation intended for application to the skin or mucous membranes

==== powdered extract
alt:[spray-dried extract]

dry extract in powder form, typically produced by spray drying

=== Biological and cultivation

==== cultivation

practice of growing medicinal plants under controlled or semi-controlled
conditions

==== wild collection
alt:[wild harvesting]
alt:[wild crafting]

gathering of medicinal plants from their natural habitat

NOTE: Wild collection requires sustainable practices to ensure species
conservation.

==== sustainable harvesting

collection of plant material in a manner that ensures the long-term survival
of the species and its ecosystem

NOTE: Sustainable harvesting considers regeneration rates, ecological impact,
and biodiversity conservation.

==== Good Agricultural Practices
alt:[GAP]

standards and practices for the production of medicinal plants under
controlled agricultural conditions

NOTE: GAP covers site selection, propagation, cultivation, plant protection,
harvesting, and primary processing.

=== Regulatory and classification

==== dietary supplement

product intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more dietary
ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other botanicals

NOTE: Regulatory classification of phytomedicines as dietary supplements varies
by jurisdiction.

==== traditional herbal medicinal product
alt:[THMP]

medicinal product whose active ingredients are exclusively herbal substances
or herbal preparations, intended and designed for use without the supervision
of a medical practitioner

NOTE: Traditional use of at least 30 years, including 15 years within the
relevant jurisdiction, is typically required for THMP status.

==== health claim

statement that describes the relationship between a food or food component
and a disease or health-related condition

==== structure-function claim

statement that describes the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended
to affect the normal structure or function of the human body
