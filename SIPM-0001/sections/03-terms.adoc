=== active pharmaceutical ingredient
alt:[API]
alt:[active ingredient]

substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a
drug product and that, when used in the production of a drug, becomes an active
ingredient in the drug product

NOTE 1: In phytomedicine, the API may be a single compound or a defined
mixture of compounds derived from the plant material.

NOTE 2: For some phytomedicines, the active constituents are not fully
characterized, and the API is defined as the herbal preparation or its
standardized extract.

=== marker compound

chemical constituent or group of constituents characteristic of a particular
plant species or plant part, used for identification, quality assessment, or
standardization purposes

NOTE: Marker compounds are not necessarily responsible for the therapeutic
activity of the phytomedicine.

constituents

NOTE: Unlike standardized extracts, quantified extracts specify acceptable
ranges rather than target values.

<<ISO9000,clause 3.3.7>>

=== stability

capacity of a phytomedicine product to remain within established specifications
for identity, strength, quality, and purity throughout its shelf life

=== shelf life
alt:[expiration dating period]

time period during which a phytomedicine product is expected to remain within
approved shelf-life specifications, provided it is stored under the conditions
defined on the container label

=== good agricultural and collection practices
alt:[GACP]

practices addressing quality assurance and control in the production and
collection of medicinal plants

NOTE: GACP covers cultivation, harvesting, post-harvest processing, storage,
and transportation.

<<WHOGMP>>

=== voucher specimen

preserved sample of plant material that serves as a permanent record of the
source material used in scientific studies or commercial production

NOTE: Voucher specimens enable verification of botanical identity and are
typically deposited in recognized herbaria.

[[sec-functional-terms]]
=== Functional classification terms

==== adaptogen

natural compound or plant extract that increases the adaptability, resilience,
and survival of organisms to stress through non-specific activation of adaptive
mechanisms

NOTE 1: Adaptogens exhibit a normalizing effect independent of the nature of
the pathological state (stres-protective activity).

NOTE 2: Key mechanisms include modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis, regulation of cortisol release, and enhancement of cellular stress
resistance via heat shock proteins and neuropeptide Y <<Panossian2021>>.

NOTE 3: Plant-derived adaptogens include _Eleutherococcus senticosus_
(Eleuthero), _Withania somnifera_ (Ashwagandha), _Rhodiola rosea_ (Rhodiola),
and _Panax ginseng_ (Ginseng).

[.source]
<<Panossian2021>> (evolution of the adaptogenic concept from traditional use to
medical applications)

==== nootropic
alt:[cognitive enhancer]

substance that improves cognitive function (memory, attention, learning, or
executive function) without significant sedation or stimulation

NOTE 1: The term "nootropic" was coined by Giurgea in 1972 and originally
required the substance to enhance learning and memory, protect against
disruptive agents, have minimal side effects, and increase cortical control.

NOTE 2: Plant-derived nootropics include _Bacopa monnieri_ (bacosides),
_Ginkgo biloba_ (flavonoid glycosides, terpene lactones), _Panax ginseng_
(ginsenosides), and _Coffea arabica_ (caffeine) <<Nieto2022>>.

NOTE 3: Systematic reviews indicate that _Ginkgo biloba_ is most relevant for
perceptual and motor functions, while _Bacopa monnieri_ improves language,
learning, and memory <<Garcia2022>>.

[.source]
<<Nieto2022>> (plant-derived nootropics and human cognition: systematic review)

==== immunomodulator

substance that can modify or regulate one or more immune functions

NOTE: Immunomodulators may be immunostimulatory (enhancing immune response) or
immunosuppressive (reducing immune response). Many phytomedicines exhibit
immunomodulatory activity, including _Echinacea_ spp., _Astragalus
membranaceus_, and medicinal fungi such as _Ganoderma lucidum_.

==== antioxidant

substance that inhibits oxidation, neutralizes free radicals, or chelates
metal ions that catalyze oxidative reactions

NOTE: Many phytomedicines contain antioxidant compounds including polyphenols,
flavonoids, carotenoids, and vitamins C and E. Antioxidant activity is often
measured using ORAC, FRAP, or DPPH assays.

==== anti-inflammatory

substance that reduces inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory mediators,
cytokines, or enzymes involved in the inflammatory cascade

NOTE: Plant-derived anti-inflammatory compounds include curcuminoids
(_Curcuma longa_), boswellic acids (_Boswellia serrata_), and omega-3 fatty
acids.
