== Introduction

The field of phytomedicine encompasses the study and therapeutic use of plant-
derived substances for the prevention and treatment of disease. As interest in
natural health products has grown globally, the need for standardized terminology
has become increasingly important to ensure clear communication among
researchers, healthcare practitioners, regulators, manufacturers, and consumers.

This document establishes a comprehensive vocabulary for phytomedicine that
provides a foundation for consistent use of terms across scientific literature,
regulatory documents, product labels, and clinical communications. The
terminology presented here has been developed through consensus among
international experts in pharmacognosy, botany, chemistry, pharmacology,
toxicology, and clinical medicine.

The terminology in this document is organized into two main sections:

* Clause 3 defines core concepts that are essential for understanding
  phytomedicine and its related fields
* Clause 4 provides additional vocabulary for specific domains within
  phytomedicine

This document is intended to serve as a reference for authors of scientific
papers, developers of regulatory guidelines, manufacturers of phytomedicine
products, and healthcare professionals who recommend or prescribe phytomedicines.

The development of this terminology standard reflects SIPM's commitment to
advancing the scientific basis of phytomedicine while respecting traditional
knowledge systems. The definitions provided here are designed to be precise
enough for scientific use while remaining accessible to diverse stakeholders
in the phytomedicine community.

Future revisions of this document will incorporate new terms as the field
evolves and will refine existing definitions based on scientific advances and
feedback from users of the standard.
