== Normative references

The following documents are referred to in the text in such a way that some or
all of their content constitutes requirements of this document. For dated
references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest
edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.

* [[[REFID1,{Full Reference Title}]]]

* [[[REFID2,{Full Reference Title}]]]

* [[[REFID3,{Full Reference Title}]]]

[Note: Use a consistent citation key format. REFID should be a short, memorable
identifier. Include document number, year, and title for standards.]
