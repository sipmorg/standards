alt:[medicinal mushroom]

fungal species that contains substances which can be used for therapeutic
purposes or which are precursors for the synthesis of useful drugs

=== basidiomycete

member of the phylum Basidiomycota, characterized by the production of
spores on a basidium

NOTE: Common medicinal basidiomycetes include Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum),
Shiitake (Lentinula edodes), and Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor).

=== ascomycete

member of the phylum Ascomycota, characterized by the production of spores

=== species complex

group of closely related species that are difficult to distinguish morphologically
