== Nomenclature standards

=== General requirements

This clause establishes standards for the use of nomenclature in scientific
publications, product labels, and regulatory documents.

=== Documentation requirements

==== Required elements

The following elements shall be included in all references to medicinal fungi:

a) Scientific name (genus and species)
b) Authority citation (on first mention)
c) Part of fungus used (fruiting body, mycelium, sclerotium, etc.)
d) Source (wild-collected or cultivated)

==== Recommended elements

The following elements are recommended for comprehensive documentation:

* Strain identifier (if applicable)
* Geographic origin
* Cultivation method
* Harvest date

=== Product labeling

==== Standard format

Product labels shall include the scientific name of the fungal ingredient.

[example]
Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) fruiting body extract

==== Common names

Common names may be included alongside scientific names but shall not replace
them as the primary identifier.

=== Quality control documentation

==== Voucher specimens

Voucher specimens shall be preserved for all medicinal fungi used in research
or commercial production.

NOTE: See SIPM-0001 for requirements for voucher specimens.

==== Identification records

Records shall be maintained documenting the taxonomic identification process,
including:

* Morphological characteristics observed
* Reference materials used for comparison
* Name and qualifications of the identifier
* Date of identification

=== Species-specific requirements

==== Ganoderma species

Due to taxonomic complexity within the _Ganoderma_ genus, identification shall
include:

* Macroscopic characteristics of the fruiting body
* Microscopic characteristics of spores and hyphae
* Geographic origin information
* DNA barcoding using ITS region (mandatory for commercial products)

NOTE: The _Ganoderma lucidum_ species complex contains multiple cryptic species.
_Molecular identification is essential as morphological characteristics overlap
significantly between species_ <<Zhou2015>>. Asian cultivated "Lingzhi" is
typically _G. lingzhi_ (syn. _G. sichuanense_), not European _G. lucidum_
sensu stricto <<Du2023>>.

==== Ophiocordyceps/Cordyceps species

_Ophiocordyceps sinensis_ (formerly _Cordyceps sinensis_) products shall
specify:

* Species identity (_O. sinensis_, _C. militaris_, or other)
* Whether the product contains the natural complex (fungus + host) or cultured
  mycelium
* Authentication method used (DNA barcoding recommended)

NOTE: _O. sinensis_ is endangered in the wild and subject to CITES regulations
in some jurisdictions. Cultured alternatives (_C. militaris_) are commonly
used. Adulteration with other species is a significant quality concern;
HPLC-MS/MS methods have been developed for authentication <<Li2024>>.

==== Trametes/Coriolus species

_Products derived from_ Trametes versicolor _(syn._ Coriolus versicolor _) shall
specify:_

* Bioactive compound type: PSK (polysaccharide-K), PSP (polysaccharopeptide), or
  crude extract
* β-glucan content (minimum percentage dry weight)
* Strain information if applicable

NOTE: PSK (Krestin) is approved as an adjuvant cancer therapy in Japan, with
clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating improved
survival in colorectal and breast cancer patients <<Fisher2023>>.

==== Hericium species

_Products derived from_ Hericium erinaceus _shall specify:_

* Source material: fruiting body, mycelium, or combined
* Preparation method: hot water extraction, ethanol extraction, or other
* Erinacine content (for mycelium-based products) or hericenone content (for
  fruiting body products)

NOTE: Erinacines (from mycelium) and hericenones (from fruiting body) are
the primary neurotrophic compounds. These compounds promote nerve growth factor
(NGF) synthesis through different mechanisms <<Contato2025>>.

==== Inonotus species

_Products derived from_ Inonotus obliquus _(Chaga) shall specify:_

* Source: wild-harvested or cultivated
* Host tree species (wild-harvested): birch (_Betula_ spp.) is the primary host
* Extraction method: hot water, ethanol, or dual extraction
* Betulinic acid and inotodiol content where applicable

NOTE: Chaga's bioactive profile varies significantly with host tree species
and extraction method. Betulin and betulinic acid are derived primarily from
birch bark and accumulate in the fungal sclerotium <<Glamo2022023>>.
