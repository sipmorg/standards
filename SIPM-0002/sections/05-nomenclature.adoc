== Nomenclature standards

=== General requirements

This clause establishes standards for the use of nomenclature in scientific
publications, product labels, and regulatory documents.

=== Documentation requirements

==== Required elements

The following elements shall be included in all references to medicinal fungi:

a) Scientific name (genus and species)
b) Authority citation (on first mention)
c) Part of fungus used (fruiting body, mycelium, sclerotium, etc.)
d) Source (wild-collected or cultivated)

==== Recommended elements

The following elements are recommended for comprehensive documentation:

* Strain identifier (if applicable)
* Geographic origin
* Cultivation method
* Harvest date

=== Product labeling

==== Standard format

Product labels shall include the scientific name of the fungal ingredient.

[example]
Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) fruiting body extract

==== Common names

Common names may be included alongside scientific names but shall not replace
them as the primary identifier.

=== Quality control documentation

==== Voucher specimens

Voucher specimens shall be preserved for all medicinal fungi used in research
or commercial production.

NOTE: See SIPM-0001 for requirements for voucher specimens.

==== Identification records

Records shall be maintained documenting the taxonomic identification process,
including:

* Morphological characteristics observed
* Reference materials used for comparison
* Name and qualifications of the identifier
* Date of identification

=== Species-specific requirements

==== Ganoderma species

Due to taxonomic complexity within the Ganoderma genus, identification shall
include:

* Macroscopic characteristics of the fruiting body
* Microscopic characteristics of spores and hyphae
* Geographic origin information

==== Cordyceps species

Cordyceps products shall specify:

* Species identity (C. sinensis, C. militaris, or other)
* Whether the product contains the natural complex (fungus + host) or
  cultured mycelium

NOTE: C. sinensis is endangered in the wild; cultured alternatives are
commonly used.
