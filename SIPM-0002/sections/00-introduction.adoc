== Introduction

Medicinal fungi have been used for therapeutic purposes across cultures for
millennia. In recent decades, scientific research has validated many traditional
uses and identified bioactive compounds with significant pharmacological
properties. As the medicinal fungi industry grows, accurate taxonomy and
standardized nomenclature become essential for quality control, safety, and
regulatory compliance.

This document establishes standards for the taxonomic classification and
nomenclature of medicinal fungi used in phytomedicine and natural health
products. It addresses the unique challenges of fungal taxonomy, including
the distinction between anamorph and teleomorph states, the complexity of
fungal species complexes, and the need for consistent naming across scientific,
commercial, and regulatory contexts.

The standards presented here are designed to:

* Ensure accurate identification of medicinal fungi species
* Promote consistent nomenclature in scientific and commercial contexts
* Facilitate communication between researchers, manufacturers, and regulators
* Support quality control and traceability throughout the supply chain
* Contribute to the conservation of medicinal fungi biodiversity

This document is intended to be used in conjunction with SIPM-0001 (Terminology
for Phytomedicine) and relevant analytical standards in the SIPM-0300 series.
