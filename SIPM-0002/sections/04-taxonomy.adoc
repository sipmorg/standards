== Taxonomic classification

=== General requirements

The taxonomic classification of medicinal fungi shall follow the International
Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).

=== Taxonomic hierarchy

Medicinal fungi shall be classified according to the following taxonomic
hierarchy:

* Kingdom
* Phylum
* Class
* Order
* Family
* Genus
* Species

=== Scientific names

==== Latin binomial

The scientific name of a medicinal fungus shall be expressed as a Latin
binomial consisting of genus name (capitalized) and species epithet
(lowercase).

[example]
Ganoderma lucidum, Cordyceps sinensis, Lentinula edodes

==== Author citation

When first mention of a species is made in a document, the author citation
shall be included.

[example]
Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst.

==== Taxonomic authorities

Taxonomic nomenclature shall be verified against recognized databases:

* Index Fungorum
* MycoBank
* GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
* UNITE database for molecular identification

=== Synonyms and deprecated names

==== Synonym handling

When a species has known synonyms, the currently accepted name shall be used
as the primary identifier. Common synonyms may be listed for reference.

==== Deprecated names

Names that have been taxonomically rejected or superseded shall be marked as
deprecated and shall not be used as primary identifiers.

[[dna-authentication]]
=== DNA-based authentication

DNA barcoding shall be performed when morphological identification is
inconclusive or when verification of species identity is required for quality
control purposes.

==== ITS region as primary barcode

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA shall be
used as the primary DNA barcode for fungal identification.

NOTE: The ITS region is formally recognized as the universal DNA barcode for
fungi by the Consortium for the Barcode of Life <<Schoch2012>>.

==== Required elements for DNA barcoding

DNA barcoding analysis shall include the following elements:

a) Primer pair: ITS1/ITS4 (or equivalent universal fungal primers) <1>
b) Reference database: UNITE (https://unite.ut.ee) <2>
c) Sequence similarity threshold: ≥99% for species-level identification <3>
d) Documentation: GenBank accession number for reference sequences

<1> Universal primers such as ITS1 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS4
(5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') provide coverage for >99% of ascomycete and
basidiomycete taxa <<Tooming2012>>.
<2> UNITE is the primary reference database for fungal ITS sequences with
curated species hypotheses <<Nilsson2019>>.
<3> A threshold of 99% sequence similarity is suitable for distinguishing
species in most fungal lineages using the entire ITS region <<Ritok2016>>.

==== Quality control requirements

DNA barcoding for quality control shall meet the following criteria:

* DNA extraction: Use validated extraction methods yielding high-quality DNA
  (A260/A280 ratio 1.8-2.0)
* PCR amplification: Positive control (known species) and negative control
  (no template) shall be included
* Sequencing: Bidirectional sequencing with minimum 2x coverage
* Data analysis: BLAST comparison against curated reference sequences
* Reporting: Sequence identity percentage, alignment length, and E-value
  shall be documented

==== Species complexes

For species within taxonomically complex groups (e.g., _Ganoderma lucidum_
complex, _Cordyceps sinensis_ complex), ITS sequencing alone may be
insufficient for definitive identification. In such cases, multilocus
phylogenetic analysis using additional markers (e.g., EF1-α, RPB2, nLSU)
shall be performed <<Zhou2015>>.

NOTE: The taxonomic status of _Ganoderma lucidum_ remains complex; molecular
studies indicate that the name has been applied to multiple distinct species.
_The name "G. lingzhi" is commonly applied to cultivated Asian strains,
while European "G. lucidum" represents a different taxon_ <<Zhou2015>>.
For commercial products, DNA-based authentication is strongly recommended
<<Adotey2025>>.
