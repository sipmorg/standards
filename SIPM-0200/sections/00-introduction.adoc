== Introduction

The quality of phytomedicine products begins with the quality of the raw plant
material. Agricultural practices directly influence the identity, purity,
potency, and safety of medicinal plants and, consequently, the final products
derived from them. This standard establishes requirements for the cultivation,
collection, and primary processing of medicinal plants to ensure consistent
quality throughout the supply chain.

This document is aligned with international guidelines, including the WHO
Guidelines on Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) for Medicinal
Plants, and incorporates additional requirements specific to the phytomedicine
industry.

The standard addresses the complete agricultural production cycle:

* Site selection and preparation
* Propagation and cultivation
* Plant protection and pest management
* Harvesting and primary processing
* Storage and transportation

Implementation of this standard supports:

* Traceability of medicinal plant materials
* Consistency of phytochemical profiles
* Minimization of contamination risks
* Environmental sustainability
* Social responsibility in medicinal plant production
