[[sec-heavy-metals]]
=== Heavy metal management

==== Soil testing requirements

Prior to cultivation, soil shall be tested for heavy metal contamination.
Maximum allowable limits in soil (mg/kg dry weight) are:

[[table-soil-metal-limits]]
.Maximum heavy metal limits in cultivation soil
[cols="50%,50%"]
|===
| Heavy metal | Maximum limit (mg/kg)

| Cadmium (Cd) | 1.0
| Lead (Pb) | 100
| Mercury (Hg) | 1.0
| Arsenic (As) | 10
| Copper (Cu) | 100
| Zinc (Zn) | 300
|===

NOTE: These limits are based on international guidelines for agricultural
soil quality <<WHO2017>>. Some medicinal plants are known hyperaccumulators
of certain metals and may require more stringent limits.

==== Transfer factors

Some medicinal plants accumulate heavy metals at higher rates than others.
Species with documented accumulation concerns include:

* _Hypericum perforatum_: Accumulates Mn and Zn; levels decrease with
  increasing soil pH <<Kwiecien2021>>
* _Withania somnifera_: Moderate accumulator; soil pH affects metal uptake
  <<Kumar2025>>

When cultivating these species, additional soil testing and plant tissue
analysis shall be conducted to ensure compliance with finished product limits
(see SIPM-0300).
