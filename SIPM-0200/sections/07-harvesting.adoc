=== Harvest timing

==== Optimal harvest time

Harvest timing shall be determined based on:

* Phytochemical content of the target plant part
* Stage of plant development
* Time of day (for species where this affects quality)
* Environmental conditions

==== Documentation

The rationale for harvest timing decisions shall be documented.

[cols="30%,30%,40%"]
|===
| Species | Plant part | Optimal harvest timing

| _Echinacea purpurea_
| Roots
| Late autumn (after first frost) or early spring of second year;
  alkamide content peaks at 120-150 days <<Moghith2024>>

| _Echinacea purpurea_
| Aerial parts
| At full bloom (60-90 days); cichoric acid peaks at flowering
  <<Stuart2004>>

| _Withania somnifera_
| Roots
| 150-180 days after sowing; at plant maturity when leaves yellow
  <<Kumar2025>>

| _Panax ginseng_
| Roots
| 4-6 years (cultivated); ginsenoside profile stable after year 4
  <<Kim2023>>

| _Hypericum perforatum_
| Flowering tops
| At full bloom (early flowering stage); hypericin peaks at bud
  break through full flower <<Frontiers2022>>

| _Silybum marianum_
| Seeds (achenes)
| When seed heads turn brown; 100-140 days after sowing
  <<Karkanis2011>>

==== Time of day considerations

For species where phytochemical content varies diurnally:

* _Hypericum perforatum_: Harvest in late morning after dew has dried;
  hypericin content may be affected by light exposure <<Kwiecien2021>>
* _Echinacea purpurea_: Aerial parts harvested mid-morning to afternoon;
  avoid early morning when moisture is high

==== Environmental factors

Environmental conditions at harvest shall be documented:

* Temperature at time of harvest
* Recent precipitation (within 48 hours)
* General weather conditions
* Time of day

[[sec-harvest-methods]]
=== Harvest methods

==== Personnel requirements

Harvest personnel shall be trained in:

* Correct plant part identification
* Harvesting techniques
* Hygiene requirements
* Recognition of contamination or quality issues

==== Equipment

Harvest equipment shall be:

* Clean and in good working condition
* Constructed of materials that do not contaminate plant material
* Regularly inspected and maintained

[[sec-field-handling]]
=== Field handling

==== Contamination prevention

Harvested material shall be protected from contamination during handling:

* Clean containers shall be used
* Contact with soil shall be minimized
* Material shall not be placed directly on the ground

==== Temperature management

For temperature-sensitive materials:

* Exposure to direct sunlight shall be minimized
* Material shall be transported to processing area promptly
* Temporary storage conditions shall be documented
